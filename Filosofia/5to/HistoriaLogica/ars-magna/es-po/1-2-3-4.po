"10. The green triangle consisting of difference, concordance and contrariety "

"contrariety because more things can be different than concordant or "

"mentally by discerning and conserving the three said species of difference, "
"concordance and contrariety while descending and ascending through them. The "
"intellect is simply and objectively general with difference as well as with "
"concordance and contrariety; but when it focuses on the ladder formed by "
"the three species, it is neither altogether general nor altogether specific, "

"11. The red triangle consisting of beginning, middle and end is general to "
"all things because it contains everything, since everything in existence is "
"in the beginning, middle, or end so that nothing can exist without these "
"terms. A beginning, or principle is something followed by everything else. "
"There is no way that a universal principle can exist, be it natural or "
"moral, unless it includes within itself its own intrinsic active principle, "
"passive principle and functional principle. Now heat cannot naturally exist "
"without the heater with its heatable and their heating; and likewise a "
"principle cannot naturally exist without its three natural intrinsic "
"principles. The artist must know that the three intrinsic correlatives of "
"each universal principle are its essence's own subjective causal properties, "
"and he must know how to distinguish these essential correlatives from the "
"morally acquired accidental ones. Causal principles are necessary whereas "
"accidental ones are contingent and meant for well being. In this way, the "

"13. In the saffron triangle we understand that there is one universal "

"goodness are essentially equal and the same applies to intellect and will, "

"C are very easy, useful and clear because the thing defined converts into "
"its definition and vice versa: like goodness is a being that functions by "
