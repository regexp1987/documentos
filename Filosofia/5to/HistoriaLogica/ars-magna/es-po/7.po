"2. Column BCD of the table showed by example how twenty reasons can apply to "
"the same conclusion in answer to the question: \"Is the world eternal?\". "
"Likewise, we can multiply this figure's cameras beginning with BCD, BCE, all "
"the way to camera BCK and each camera yields twenty reasons. Second, we "
"continue multiplying cameras through BDE, BDF, etc. where each camera also "
"yields twenty reasons. Third, we continue multiplying successive cameras as "
"we treat camera CDE like we treated BCD in the previous multiplications. And "
"DEF is treated as was CDE, and so on with the others in their way, ending "
"with camera HIK as we artificially revolve the circles again and again until "
"the eighty-four columns of the table are formed. This feature of figure "
"four was mentioned in part 5 about the table. Here, multiplication brings "
"each principle into multiple combinations with the others and each principle "
"takes on the habits of the others with proper and appropriated passions. "
"Further, in the fourth multiplication, figure four contains figure three: "
"for instance, camera BCD contains cameras BC and CD of figure three, and "
"likewise camera CDE contains cameras CD and DE of figure three, and so with "
"the others."

"3. In camera BCD and in other cameras, C stands in the middle circle between "
"B and D and as C joins B to D due to certain positions, habits and "
"situations that occur between subjects and predicates, this art always uses "
"the middle circle to investigate the middle term. Now as \"animal\" stands as "
"a middle term of measure and conjunction between \"substance\" and \"man\" when "
"we conclude that man is a substance, likewise the letter in the middle "
"circle must stand between the letter in the upper circle and the letter in "
"the lower circle, in arguing as follows: all C is B, but all D is C, "
"therefore all D is B. And as certain conjectures and passions necessarily "
"lead to conclude that an animal is a substance and man is an animal, so "
"should the artist of this art conjecture the things signified by BCD, namely "
"the subalternate principles where B says or means goodness, difference and "
"whether; C signifies greatness, concordance and what; and D signifies "
"duration, contrariety and of what. And the things said or signified by the "
"letters include the definitions of the principles and the species of the "
"rules used by the artist to conjecture about any issue by matching the "
"middle term with the letters above and below it. <br> And here the intellect "
"builds science with universal affirmation and universal negation, "
"particular affirmation and particular negation, <br> exceptions, <br> "
"demonstration, <br> directed combination, <br> possibility and "
"impossibility."

"4. The intellect acquires the habit of using these five modes as follows, by "
"saying: \"All C is B, and all D is C,\" which is proved as we recognize, for "
"instance, that greatness is good on account of goodness and goodness is "
"great on account of greatness; and goodness has great correlatives signified "
"by the second species of C and greatness has good correlatives signified by "
"goodness and the second species of C. And likewise with greatness and "
"duration with their respective conditions."

"5. Saying that all C is B and all D is C involves universal affirmation and "
"negation as well as particular affirmation and negation because B implies "
"difference and D implies contrariety. <br> First we say: \"All animals are "
"substance. But all men are animals, therefore all men are substance.\" <br> "
"Second: \"No animal is a stone. But all men are animals, therefore no man is "
"a stone.\" <br> Third: \"All animals are substance. But some men are animals, "
"therefore some men are substance.\" In other words: all C is B but some of D "
"is C, therefore some of D is B. This is because contrariety implied by D "
"cannot be concordance implied by C, nor can great evil be great good for if "
"it could, an object would be intrinsically opposed to itself, which is "
"impossible and against the correlatives in the second species of rule C. "
"<br> Fourth, we say: \"No animal is a stone. But some men are animals, "
"therefore some men are not stones.\" In other words: \"No C is B, but some D "
"is C therefore some D is not B.\" This reasoning is patterned on the third "
"syllogism which concludes with a particular affirmation."

"6. The four ways of making syllogisms we described first indicate instances "
"of necessary reasons to the intellect, as when it negates that all C is B, "
"since created goodness cannot be created greatness because difference posits "
"that each principle exists per se, but also posits that it is possible for "
"goodness to be habituated with greatness; and when the intellect affirms "
"that not all B is D and not all D is C, it can tell what is possible or "
"impossible. Then it sees how to demonstrations are made with the first "
"species of rule G and directed combinations with the second species of rule "
"G: this is indicated by all the cameras containing G in the third figure."

"7. Second, the intellect finds means to contract the principles, by taking "
"an entirely general principle and contracting it to a principle that is "
"neither entirely general nor entirely specific. Difference, for instance, as "
"a supremely, or entirely general principle, is contracted to the "
"differences between sensual things, which are neither entirely general nor "
"entirely specific. And when it is contracted to the ultimately or entirely "
"specific differences like those of a given animal, a given plant or a given "
"stone, where the individual is constituted both substantially and "
"accidentally of its own quantity, quality, etc. and the individual is placed "
"in its own species etc., those intermediary differences are middle terms "
"between entirely general and entirely specific principles. And we can say "
"the same about goodness, etc. as about difference: now goodness is a "
"supremely general principle and when it is contracted to greatness, etc. "
"then it is neither supremely general nor supremely specific; but when great "
"goodness is contracted to a given concrete being constituted of this great "
"goodness, in its form, its matter and in its quantity, its quality etc. and "
"when this being is placed in its own species, in which it becomes "
"individuated, then the great goodness which is neither supremely general nor "
"supremely special is a middle term standing between abstract and concrete "
"things, and participating in the nature of both extremes. This naturally "
"allows the artist to find the middle term that naturally stands between the "
"major premise and the minor premise. And through this middle term, "
"demonstrations proceed from primordial, true and necessary principles not "
"subject to any exceptions."

"8. Third, the middle term is found under its own letter and in its own "
"circle, namely under F which stands for the middle term and in the middle "
"circle: for instance as we put F under B and above C, considering that F has "
"goodness and difference from B and also greatness and concordance from C; "
"and thus F stands between B and C, on account of which C transits through a "
"middle term to B, as when we say: \"All F is B, but all C is F, therefore all "
"C is B,\" but only with regard to the genus of medium. And what we said "
"about camera BFC also applies to camera CFD and to camera DFE, etc. The "
"things said here about the middle term provide the artist with very general "
"subject matter for finding many middle terms. And this is clearly shown by "
"the definitions of the principles and the species of the rules."

"9. Proof is a general entity divided into three species, namely "
"demonstration by cause, by equality and by effect. Let us now give an "
"example with the following syllogism: \"All animals are substance, but all "
"men are animals, therefore all men are substance.\" First we will prove the "
"major premise, then the minor one. And let us begin with a demonstration by "
"cause: an animal is constituted of differences between various sensual "
"things, because it is elemented, vegetated and endowed with senses and "
"imagination, whence it follows that it is a substance because it is composed "
"of substantial parts, and as substance stands above and the animal below, "
"so this animal is caused by higher causes, namely its constituting form and "
"matter and its parts are below because they are caused by form and matter "
"which are general principles. And thus we truly conclude, according to the "
"causes, that animals are substance."

"10. The same is proved as follows with a demonstration by equality: general "
"form and general matter are equally primordial causes, as the first species "
"of rule D shows, and as an animal is cause by its own form and its own "
"matter sequentially combined with the elementative power, the vegetative "
"power, etc. which are equally principles of this animal, it then follows "
"that an animal is a substance constituted of its own form and matter which "
"equally descend from equal and supremely general principles, namely prime "
"form and prime matter. And this is shown by the second species of rule D, "
"the first species of rule E and by rule B."
msgstr ""

#: en/7.htm+html.body.blockquote.blockquote.p:158

"Third, let us demonstrate the same by effect: an animal exists, and because "
"it exists, so do its causes, namely its constituting form and matter without "
"which it cannot be what it is. And since form and matter constitute "
"substance, it truly follows that this animal is a substance."

"11. Now let us prove the minor premise with the same three species, "
"beginning with proof by cause. As an embryo is constituted of the "
"elementative, vegetative etc. in the womb where it is outlined to grow into "
"the shape of human limbs, and when the rational soul, which is a substance, "
"is introduced into the embryo, it then constitutes a human being from itself "
"and its lower parts. And thus, the animal that is the embryo, is transmuted "
"into a human by the human species in which it is placed with all its "
"coessential parts. And so it follows that the soul is the cause on account "
"of which man is an animate substance. And the first species of rule C "
"clearly shows this."
msgstr ""

#: en/7.htm+html.body.blockquote.blockquote.p:171
msgid ""
"12. The proof by equality goes as follows: the rational soul has equal "
"coessential parts, namely intellect, memory and will, as does the embryo "
"which is equally constituted of the elementative, vegetative etc. And as its "
"principles are substantial and equal, man is entirely, equally and "
"substantially comprised of these principles when the rational soul is joined "
"to the human body. And thus, rules B C D E clearly show that man is an "
"animal."

"13. The proof by effect is as follows: Socrates exists because he is an "
"animal, without which he cannot exist. The minor has been proved with the "
"three said species of proof, and of these, the ones that yield the most "
"powerful conclusions are the proofs by cause and by equality; proofs by "
"effect are not as potent because causes have preponderance over effects."

"14. Further, just as we gave an example of proofs that man is a substance "
