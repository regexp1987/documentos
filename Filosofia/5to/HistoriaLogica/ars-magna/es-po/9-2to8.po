"1. An angel's goodness is a reason for it to do good, and inasmuch as this "
"reason is great, it is a reason for it to do great good, and inasmuch as it "
"is durable, it is a reason for it to do durable good etc. However I am not "
"saying that one angel produces or engenders another angel, because if this "
"were so, the angel would empty itself by reason of its newness, finiteness "
"and indivisibility, all of which are removed from length and breadth. What "
"an angel has in itself, is a good act of understanding, loving and "
"remembering natural principles. Moreover, angels exchange good words with "
"each other. But the intellect wonders, given that angels have no tongue or "
"organs of speech, how can this conversation happen? Then it remembers that "
"their conversation is nothing but a good act of mutual understanding, loving "
"and remembering, and all of this is good by reason of their goodness."

"angel's power, with which it acts as if they were instruments for powering; "
"now just like heat is an accident with which fire can act to heat things, "
"likewise, and even much more, are the correlatives of an angel's power the "
"means with which it can exist and act, because these are its consubstantial "

"like an instrument for understanding (although it is consubstantial to the "
"angel, just as its other principles are consubstantial) in the same way that "
"a man's will is used for willing, and even much more so, because man cannot "

"remembers that an angel has virtuous habits as it objectifies objects "
"through virtuous understanding and loving and through just, prudent and "

"19. With rule B we ask: do angels exist? This rule, through the mixture of "

"the principles, let us go back to some things that were said in part 8, "
"section 1, chapter 1 about goodness. In the beginning of this chapter, it is "
"stated that goodness is a reason for good to do or to produce good, and as "
"it is great in greatness, there is a dual reason for good to produce great "
"good, and divine wisdom knows this because it is good and great. Hence, as "
"divine will is equal in greatness to divine goodness, wisdom etc. it wills "
"that there be angels, and therefore angels exist."

"knowable and lovable, and so is its effect, namely angels, and so angels "
"exist as they are a great and good effect, the greatest and best that can be "
"among created beings. And if angels did not exist, knowing the effect of "

"And we answer that it is not, because if it were essentially different, the "
"elements would not have a subject in which they could enter into "
"composition, and the elementative would not proceed from generation but from "
"creation; and the qualities of the elements would change into new subjects; "
