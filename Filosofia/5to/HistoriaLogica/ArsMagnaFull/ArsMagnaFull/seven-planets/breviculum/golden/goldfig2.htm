<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>I
really have no qualms about quoting Proclus in this way,&nbsp; since these
rough examples, true as they are, raise the intellect to understand the
above statements on a higher level. And by this I mean that in the said
example the prime cause is not merely the cause of man's being&nbsp; but
also of man's being alive and being rational, because life and reason are
also entirely effects of GOD's creation.</font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;Now&nbsp;
whatever exists, is either creator or creature. Therefore the world is
either GOD, or a creature.&nbsp; But the world, being finite and visible,
is not GOD. This truth is obvious to our senses. Therefore it exists as
a created being, as the effect of a cause, and not per se, as nothing can
be its own cause; thus it is simply an effect caused by GOD, as are all
things in this world.</font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;
So far we have not said anything about the orderly return to GOD of creatures
from the lowest of their dwellings, as we wished to give the above preliminary
information, which will be useful later on. The natural Chaos of the elements
in a confused mixture is the lowest material cause of all things subject
to generation and corruption, and accordingly stands at the lowest level
as shown.</font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;First
to rise out of the said confusion are compound bodies of the elements,
with a continuous appetite to seek out the places that GOD&nbsp; predestined
for them and where their own nature is preserved in greater power, existing
more simply on its own, less compounded with other elements; but as they
can never fulfill their intention by remaining there, they try other places
and flee from confusion with the selfsame intention and appetite and belief
that they can overcome&nbsp; other elements in the substantial beings they
form as they enter into composition. Therefore they generate a mixed elemented
body disposed in the order of elemental degrees, an order that they naturally
seek, to escape confusion; and this is the initial point and first degree
of ascent of&nbsp; bodies subject to decay.</font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>Next
in ascending order above the said simple body the second degree of physical
being arises through the process of composition, simply animated per se
and containing all vegetal beings produced by the active, passive and functioning
vegetative power.</font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;Above
vegetation the third degree arises in sentient animals or beasts and follows
a natural ascending scale of perfection until the highest degree of perfection
in animals is attained. Some animals seem vile and imperfect as compared
to higher animals, yet they have sense and movement, like oysters and similar
shellfish, whose life we can sense in their stony outward aspect, and by
looking within, we see that they are endowed with their own sense as well.
They are visibly alive, and this is displayed in their sense of touch,
a primitive sense they noticeably display by shrinking back when touched,
and expanding when released. In addition, they open and close their shells
with a contracting and expanding motion.</font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;Sentient
life manifests a degree of perfection above vegetal life, which is immobile
and remains in one place as do inanimate bodies or stones. Some animals
like coral remain attached to stones on which they feed and are almost
more like trees than animals. And lower animals have the one sense that
all animals have in common, namely touch. Other&nbsp; animals then arise
with the same primitive sense, but greater power to move about, for they
can shrink and expand to change places as do annulata or worms. These do
not constitue another degree above the previous one, but other crawling
creatures display increasing degrees of perfection as they have more senses,
adding sight, smell, taste and even voice like snakes for instance. Other
perfect animals attain even higher perfection and being, like quadrupeds
as well as birds and fish, and it is impossible to know how many kinds
of them exist in the diversity of greater, medium and lesser perfection.</font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;Imperfect
animals as well as all living beings have appetite and instinct. Appetite
and instinct are more or less developed in greater and lesser beings, and
they all have them regardless of their degree of perfection. Now whatever
can be watered and fed has appetite, but in plants it is more gross and
less perceptible to the senses. Instinct can be observed in plants, although
in a less apparent form, for instance, a grapevine has tendrils instead
of hands to raise it as it climbs and seeks out its source of energy, instinctively
forming a trunk with branches, boughs, flowers and fruit. Although imperceptible
to our senses, even inanimate bodies have instinct and appetite; for they
have a purpose, as nothing exists in vain. Now all created beings are imperfect
compared to their prime source, and all have an appetite for better and
greater perfection, an appetite that would be void of any purpose were
it not for their innate GOD-given instinct, and neither GOD nor nature
ever do anything without a purpose.</font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;Among
various perfect animals, greater, medium or lesser perfection is found,
for some can walk and move in all directions, but are lacking one or more
senses, like moles that have no eyes, but still have the other senses.</font></font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>Any
animal with more senses than the primitive sense of touch is classed among
perfect animals, especially walking or flying animals endowed with all
five senses that also have voices for naturally expresing what they mean,
and humans have an even more developed sense of voice called the affatus.</font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;And
the said three separate degrees are found in living beings, perceived in
distinct ascending order beginning with vegetation as the first degree
of life; followed in the next degree by sentient animals that can move
with their own contracting and expanding motion. And these are called "imperfect
animals" because they do not move from place to place, but merely with
the movement in which life is first detected. The heart moves with this
movement in perfect animals as they first come into being, and they are
said to come to life with the first heartbeat. And this visible innate
movement&nbsp; perceptibly continues in the absence of any other sensible
cause. Thus our senses of sight and touch reveal this most basic primitive
movement for instance in a decapitated bird whose heart still goes on beating,
a swan's heart especially can go on living for a long time after being
cut out and astonishingly, even when it is cut into pieces each piece still
continues to show signs of life for a while. This shows that the heart
is the principal organ of life, where life most firmly takes root, and
from which life spreads to all other organs that die when primordial movement
is stopped at the root source.</font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;The
next degree of life is found in animals that can move in all directions,
known as perfect animals because they are perfectly capable of moving in
any direction and distance as opposed to the imperfect non-local movement
described above. In their degree of perfection, they also have perfectly
organized senses with which they can work and function as perfect animals.</font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;Then
the three said degrees of life culminate in a fourth supernatural degree
far above the others, namely in man in whom they are also found joined
together in the same order; linked and mutually bonded with all their appendages
as parts that naturally compose the human body.</font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;Therefore
they are elevated to their utmost in man and through man they attain the
purpose and perfection they crave by natural appetite. And here they find
rest as they are raised up by humanity which informs them with one spiritual
and immortal form created by GOD as through it man remembers, understands
and finally above all loves GOD, for there are two created natures namely
spiritual nature existing above the heavens in angels (or separated substances
or intelligences) and physical nature, namely the prime mobile, the starry
sky and the seven planetary spheres, with the chaos of elements beneath,
and natural physical bodies subject to generation and decay. The two essences
and natures are altogether different, and have naturally separate places
and subjects and almost nothing in common apart from the fact that they
are both creatures created by GOD out of nothingness and parts of the universe
- as shown in the first Figure - , so as to form one formal and material
world through the wisdom, free will and power of the Creator.</font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;As
there must be no vacuum in such a noble work of creation and no lack of
mutual solidarity among all parts in mere natural separation without any
perfect union, man is naturally composed from all that exists in creation
so that all created beings can participate in the unity of one nature,
which is human nature. Therefore man is the center of the whole universe,
where all created beings fulfill their purpose and through man, as said
above, all physical things attain their end. Here the diligent reader can
see in which created being GOD brought creation to its perfect fulfillment,
and the purpose for which He created everything, and the idea He objectified
in His eternal mind before creation.</font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;Creatures
arise in ascending levels through clearly visible degrees from a degree
of obvious imperfection continuously through a gradual ascent that finally
leads them to man, in whom as we have said they can attain perfect fulfillment
of purpose and ultimate bliss. And this would be impossible without goodness,
greatnes, duration, power, wisdom, will, virtue, truth and glory, and even
more impossible without the intrinsic natural acts of these dignities,
namely active good, passive good and functioning good and the same with
the rest.</font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;And
in these principles all created beings find their origin and source of
production. From each principle, whatever exists is actual, by first and
second acts. Now without goodness nothing can be good, and without the
essence of goodness no being can originate as whatever exists must be good.
Good and Being are said to be convertible and identical. And by the same
principles all things can naturally be known as they are principles and
causes of everything.</font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;But
the said principles can in no way constitute anything without certain other
respective principles for if there were no difference between the principles
and their operations, nothing could be truly actual, since all action requires
active and passive parts, from which action must proceed. Whenever something
has even a little actual being, this actual being must be good, and even
this little is created from goodness. And goodness has no power at all
to act as a substantially productive being without the existence of active
good and passive good. and this is why difference is necessary as a natural
principle, without which nothing could have any beginning. And as this
is necessarily so, concordance must mutually concur with all principles
with their acts that mutually influence each other and also influence themselves
inwardly. Therefore if concordance is destroyed, its opposite, namely contrariety
remains which cannot exist without appetite for divergent ends, always
desirous of producing separation. This is why it is found in corruption
more than anywhere else.</font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;The
beginning must begin what is begun, as a cause must cause its effect. Therefore
all beings must necessarily have a beginning. And the middle must be a
principle as well, so the beginning can pass through the middle on its
way to the perfect end. And by the same token the end must also be a necessary
principle since nothing can be complete or perfect without an end. Now
the end moves the beginning to come to it through the intervening medium
that receives the influence of the end on the beginning, and the beginning
retransmits its influence to the end through the same medium. The end is
therefore greater than the beginning, it its the principle to which all
principles flow, and as the beginning reaches toward the end and has not
yet attained it, it is a lesser principle. But the midle, as it participates
with both is rightly called the middle.</font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;And
thus the principles of majority, equality and minority are necessary in
all things, for without them there cannot be any natural order, peace or
tranquility&nbsp; or any movement from lesser to greater being but only
confusion and separation and&nbsp; consequently, neither any cognition
nor any operation.</font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1><b>&nbsp;We
can therefore see that our being, operation, cognition, life and existence
in time all originate in the selfsame priniples. And thus all</b> <b>Raymond's
science depends on the said primordial, necessary and simply universal
principles.</b></font></font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;And
as any doubtful matter about which man can be ignorant consists of nine
things, namely GOD, angels, the heavens, man, imagination, sense, vegetation,
elements and artificial things, and as we can either be in error or&nbsp;
act rightly regarding these subjects, he mentions them in the Art.</font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;But
doubts can arise regarding the above principles and subjects and the things
implied by them, in nine or ten ways. Often doubts occur about whether
a thing exists, then about what it is, then about what it consists of,
and why it exists, and in what quantity, what quality, when, where, how
and with what means.</font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size=-1>&nbsp;And
through his knowledge of these distinctions and questions Raymond investigated
practically everything, on these the whole Art is artificially based, and
we wrote this part, which disposes the human mind to learn it more easily.
It is really very difficult for those who are not really disposed to learn
it, because this is a new art, separate from all old principles. And many
find it strange, for its principles are altogether new and unknown and
its way of treating the subject matter is astonishing and even more strange.
In addition its practical modes are bewilderingly diversified on account
of seldom used terms and of the use of letters to signify various things,
as we will see, GOD willing. And all this will be dealt with, if GOD permits,
in a way to make it easily learned and remembered. This is why we propose
to draw visual figures wherever necessary.</font></font></font></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
