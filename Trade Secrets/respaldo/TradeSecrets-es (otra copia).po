"In the second week of November 1787, Phineas Bond, British consul in "
"Philadelphia, received a visit from two English nationals. Thomas Edemsor, a "
"cotton merchant form Manchester, and Henry Royle, a calico printer from "
"Chadkirk in Cheshire, were greatly distressed. They fered lynching at the "
"hand of a mod led by city's leding merchants and they looked to the envoy of "
"His Britannic Majesty's government for shelter. Their story went as "
"fallows."

"In 1783, concurrent with British recognition of American independence, an "
"Englishman named Benjamin H. Phillips determined to establish a cotton "
"manufactury in America. In spite of severe restrictions on the exportation "
"of textile machinery and the emigration of skilled artisans, Phillips "
"purchase a carding machine and three spinning machines in England, packed "
"them dissasembled into crates declared to British customs to contain "
"Wedgwood china, and boarded the U.S. Ship Liberty at Liverpool bound for "
"Philadelphia. He had earlier sent his son to Philadelphia in anticipation of "
"the machinery's arrival. The elder Phillips died before reaching America "
"and his son received the crates, but lacking his father's knowledge of "
"machinery he could not reassemble the equipment. He then sold it to another "
"Englishmen, Joseph Hague, who managed to ssemble it but found he was unable "
"to make it work properly. Having no capital and despairing of covering the "
"operating expenses, in the spring of 1787 Hague sold the equipment to Royle, "
"who in turn sold it to Edemsor. Edemsor once again dissassembled the four "
"machines and shipped them back to England. Accourding to his testimony, he "
"patriotically purchased and repatriated the equipment “to Check the "
"Advancement of the Cotton Manufactory in America”."
