"The untimely death of the young Internet activist Aaron Swartz, apparently "
"by suicide, has prompted an outpouring of reaction in the digital world. "
"Foremost among the debates being reheated — one which had already grown in "
"the wake of larger and more daring data breaches in the past few years — is "
"whether Swartz’s activities as a “hacktivist” were being unfairly defined as "
"malicious or criminal. In particular, critics (as well as Swartz’s family "
"in a formal statement) have focused on the federal government’s indictment "
"of Swartz for downloading millions of documents from the scholarly database "
"JSTOR, an action which JSTOR itself had declined to prosecute. "

"aparentemente por suicidio, a llevado a una reacción en torrente en el mundo "

"desarrollado con la mayor y más audaz filtraciones de los últimos años, es "
"si las actividades de Swartz como \"hactivista\" estaban siendo injustamente "
"definidas como dañinas o criminales. En particular, los críticos (como "
"también la familia de Swartz en la declaración formal) se han centrado en la "
"acusación del gobierno federal de que Swartz descargo millones de "
"documentos de la base de datos académica JSTOR, una acusación que en sí "
"misma JSTOR había negado continuar."

"I believe the debate itself is far broader than the specifics of this "
"unhappy case, for if there was prosecutorial overreach it raises the "
"question of whether we as a society created the enabling condition for this "
"sort of overreach by letting the demonization of hacktivists go unanswered. "
"Prosecutors do not work in a vacuum, after all; they are more apt to pursue "
"cases where public discourse supports their actions. The debate thus raises "
"an issue that, as philosopher of language, I have spent time considering: "
"the impact of how words and terms are defined in the public sphere."

"“Lexical Warfare” is a phrase that I like to use for battles over how a term "
"is to be understood. Our political discourse is full of such battles; it is "
"pretty routine to find discussions of who gets to be called “Republican” "
"(as opposed to RINO – Republican in Name Only), what “freedom” should mean, "
"what legitimately gets to be called “rape” —and the list goes on."

"Lexical warfare is important because it can be a device to marginalize "
"individuals within their self-identified political affiliation (for example, "
"branding RINO’s defines them as something other than true Republicans), or "
"it can beguile us into ignoring true threats to freedom (focusing on threats "
"from government while being blind to threats from corporations, religion "
"and custom), and in cases in which the word in question is “rape,” the "
"definition can have far reaching consequences for the rights of women and "
"social policy.Lexical warfare is not exclusively concerned with changing the "
"definitions of words and terms — it can also work to attach either a "
"negative or positive affect to a term. Ronald Reagan and other conservatives "
"successfully loaded the word “liberal” with negative connotations, while "
"enhancing the positive aura of terms like “patriot” (few today would reject "
"the label “patriotic,” but rather argue for why they are entitled to it)."

"Over the past few years we’ve watched a lexical warfare battle slowly unfold "
"in the treatment of the term “hacktivism.” There has been an effort to "
"redefine what the word means and what kinds of activities it describes; at "
"the same time there has been an effort to tarnish the hacktivist label so "
"that anyone who chooses to label themselves as such does so at their peril."

"In the simplest and broadest sense, a hacktivist is someone who uses "
"technology hacking to effect social change. The conflict now is between "
"those who want to change the meaning of the word to denote immoral, sinister "
"activities and those who want to defend the broader, more inclusive "
"understanding of hacktivist. Let’s start with those who are trying to change "
"the meaning so that it denotes sinister activities."

"The problem is that the headlines and articles, designed to tar hacktivists "
"and make us fear them, did not reflect what the Verizon report actually "
"said. According to page 19 of the report only 3 percent of the data breaches "
"in the survey were by hacktivists — the bulk of them were by routine "
"cybercriminals, disgruntled employees and nation states (83 percent were by "
"organized criminals)."

"The “most data” claim, while accurate, gives a skewed picture. According to "
"Chris Novak, the Managing Principal of Investigative Response on Verizon’s "
"RISK Team, interviewed in ThreatPost, 2 percent of the 90 actions analyzed "
"in the report accounted for 58 percent of the data released. The interview "
"with Novak suggests that this data loss came from precisely two hacktivist "
"actions — both by spin-offs of the well-known hacktivist group Anonymous — "
"and that these large data dumps stemmed from the actions against the "
"security firm HB Gary Federal, which had publicly announced their efforts to "
"expose Anonymous, and a computer security firm called Stratfor). That means "
"that in 2011 if you were worried about an intrusion into your system it was "
"33 times more likely that the perpetrator would be a criminal, nation state "
"or disgruntled employee than a hacktivist. If you weren’t picking fights "
"with Anonymous the chances would have dropped to zero — at least according "
"to the cases analyzed in the report."

"In effect, these infosecurity media outlets cited two actions by Anonymous "

"technology in support of social causes to meaning individuals principally "

"Now let’s turn to an attempt to maintain the broader understanding of "

"Daniel Domscheit-Berg, who was turning 34. As it happened, Domscheit-Berg "
"had also been the spokesperson for Wikileaks and, after Julian Assange, the "
"group’s most visible person. He had left the organization in 2010, and now "
"he had a new venture, OpenLeaks. The party was also meant to be a coming out "

"When I arrived at the house the first thing I noticed was a large vegetable "
"garden outside. The second thing I noticed was that a tree out front had "
"been fitted out with a colorful knit wool sweater. This was the effort of "
"Daniel’s wife Anke — “knit hacking,” she called it. And around the small "
"town I saw evidence of her guerilla knit hacking. The steel poles of nearby "
"street signs had also been fitted with woolen sweaters. Most impressively, "
"though, a World War II tank, sitting outside a nearby former Nazi "
"concentration camp for women had also been knit-hacked; the entire barrel of "
"the tank’s gun had been fit with a tight colorful wool sweater and adorned "
"with some woolen flowers for good measure. I interpreted these knit-hackings "
"as counteractions to the attempts to define hacktivist as something "
"sinister; they serve as ostensive definitions of what hacktivism is and what "
"hacktivists do."

"Of course the birthday party had elements of hackerdom understood more "

"was something else: a do-it-yourself aesthetic — planting your own garden, "
"knitting your own sweaters, foraging for mushrooms and counting on a local "

"The intention here was clear: an attempt to defend the traditional, less "
"sinister understanding of hacktivism and perhaps broaden it a bit, adding "
"some positive affect to boot; more specifically, that hacking is "
"fundamentally about refusing to be intimidated or cowed into submission by "
"any technology, about understanding the technology and acquiring the power "
"to repurpose it to our individual needs, and for the good of the many. "
"Moreover, they were saying that a true hacktivist doesn’t favor new "
"technology over old — what is critical is that the technologies be in our "
"hands rather than out of our control. This ideal, theoretically, should "
"extend to beyond computer use, to technologies for food production, shelter "
"and clothing, and of course, to all the means we use to communicate with one "
"another. It would also, of course, extend to access to knowledge more "
"generally — a value that was inherent in Aaron Swartz’s hacking of the JSTOR "
"data base."

"Our responsibility in this particular episode of lexical warfare is to be "
"critical and aware of the public uses of language, and to be alert to what "
"is at stake — whether the claims made by the infosecurity industry or the "
"government, or the gestures by the hacktivists, are genuine, misleading or "
"correct. We are not passive observers in this dispute. The meaning of words "
"is determined by those of us who use language, and it has consequences. "
"Whether or not Aaron Swartz suffered because of the manipulation of the "
"public discourse surrounding hacking, his case is a reminder that it is "
"important that we be attuned to attempts to change the meanings of words in "
"consequential ways. It is important because we are the ones who will decide "
"who will win."
