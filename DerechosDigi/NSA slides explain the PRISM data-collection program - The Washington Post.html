  NSA slides explain the PRISM data-collection program


      Published: June 6, 2013

Through a top-secret program authorized by federal judges working under
the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), the U.S. intelligence
community can gain access to the servers of nine Internet companies for
a wide range of digital data. Documents describing the previously
undisclosed program, obtained by The Washington Post, show the breadth
of U.S. electronic surveillance capabilities in the wake of a widely
publicized controversy over warrantless wiretapping of U.S. domestic
telephone communications in 2005. These slides, annotated by The
Washington Post, represent a selection from the overall document, and
certain portions are redacted. Read related article
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/us-intelligence-mining-data-from-nine-us-internet-companies-in-broad-secret-program/2013/06/06/3a0c0da8-cebf-11e2-8845-d970ccb04497_story.html>.


        Introducing the program

A slide briefing analysts at the National Security Agency about the
program touts its effectiveness and features the logos of the companies
involved.

The program is called PRISM, after the prisms used to split light, which
is used to carry information on fiber-optic cables.

This note indicates that the program is the number one source of raw
intelligence used for NSA analytic reports.

The seal of
Special Source Operations, the NSA term for alliances with trusted U.S.
companies.


        Monitoring a target's communication

This diagram shows how the bulk of the worldâ€™s electronic communications
move through companies based in the United States.


        Providers and data

The PRISM program collects a wide range of data from the nine companies,
although the details vary by provider.


        Participating providers

This slide shows when each company joined the program, with Microsoft
being the first, on Sept. 11, 2007, and Apple the most recent, in
October 2012.

Does anyone find it humorous that with all of the capability the NSA,
the CIA and any other unknown clandestine agencies have at their
disposal, they couldn't keep a set of slides from leaking to the press.

I think we all know this is getting out of hand. Giving up our way of
life out of the fear of losing our way of life is insanity.  
 
I don't know if there are terrorists or not because let's get real,
there are so many high value targets in this country that if there
really were terrorists, then things would be happening daily. I feel
absolutely no threat from a terrorist and I am more likely to get hurt
from a street gang member.

One of the most important things that these slides reveal is the volume
of data available for NSA interception--upto to 10 TERA-bits per
second--and how little can actually be done with that, even with the
most powerful computers in the world. 
 
The sun would go dark before the NSA could extract meaningful
information about EVERY person whose transmissions they're examining.  
 
The NSA has to have some clear idea who/what their targets are, and mine
for what additional information they can develop abo...See More

re: Google and Yahoo and all the others have been mining our data for
years and selling it. 
 
Exactly, and add to that all of the new social media sites. Those who
use those sites - and many use them religiously (just look at the
digital devices out there that advertise easy access to social media)
seem to have no reluctance to 'put it all out there'. 
 
If you don't want it out there for someone to find, don't put it out

Ever heard of the 4th amendment? Wonder why they put that in the Bill of

Amentment IV 
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,
and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be
violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,
supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place
to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.

The Patriot Act is not the cause of this government abuse of power. The
Patriot Act has many problem areas that should be addressed. But one
safeguard it provided was the requirement that the government obtain a
court order for private surveillance. The safeguard failed in this
instance in a gigantic sweeping overreach that was somehow signed off by
federal judge Robert Vinson of the Northern District Court of Florida.

point that use of PRISM doesn't use domestic communications, so even if
the brothers had specifically mentioned the bombing to each other in a

Some people whine about anything. So when something to whine about goes

Communications traffic monitoring has been going on since BEFORE 2000.
Many conspirathy theories have been based on that system, even some TV

monitor those communications.
